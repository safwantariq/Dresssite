            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Preloved by Arooj, where dreams meet affordability!<br>
                At Preloved by Arooj, we understand the magic and significance that a wedding day holds for every bride. Just like you, I once embarked on the journey to create the perfect wedding, filled with dreams of a beautiful gown that would not only make me look stunning but also encapsulate the essence of my special day.<br>
                However, the reality struck hard when I realized that the hefty price tag attached to my bridal attire left me with a beautiful gown that, unfortunately, had limited utility in everyday life. The realization led me to question the conventional approach to wedding attire shopping.<br>
                Why spend a fortune on a dress that sees the light of day only once, when there are equally enchanting options available that won't break the bank? At Preloved by Arooj, we are driven by the passion to redefine the bridal shopping experience, making it not only memorable but also practical.<br>
                Our collection features carefully curated, minimally used bridal clothes that embody elegance and grace, allowing brides to fulfill their dreams without compromising their budget. We believe that looking breathtaking on your wedding day should not come at the cost of financial strain. By choosing more affordable options, you not only save money but also open up avenues for unforgettable experiences such as a dream honeymoon or an exciting vacation.<br>
                Our mission is to empower brides to make smart choices, guiding them towards options that align with their visions and financial goals. We invite you to explore our collection, where every gown tells a story of affordability without sacrificing style. Let's redefine the narrative of bridal elegance together, ensuring that every bride not only looks her best on her special day but also invests wisely in the journey that follows.<br>
